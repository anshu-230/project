#Codeclauseinternship_Basic Chat application using websocket 


In this project, I am building a chat application
using websocket through HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.


Websocket:

The websocket object provides the API for creating and managing a websocket connection to a server , as well as for sending and receiving data on the connection.
